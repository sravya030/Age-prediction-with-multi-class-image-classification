# Age-prediction-with-multi-class-image-classification
Human age estimation is very interesting challenge. The increasing demand of smart security 
systems has enhanced the demand for the proper identification and verification of a person. Person’s age can determine the aging process, but there are also many external factors .
For example: health, lifestyle, weather conditions, living location, etc.
And males and females may also age differently.The ideal way to extract the general aging pattern while minimizing the detrimental effects of individual’s variances is still a challenge.
This study began using and processing the face age dataset taken from Kaggle. The samples from 
the database were divided in seven classes, each one for an age range. the proposed work 
implemented traditional ML algorithms such as random forest classifier and SVC.By learning representations through the use of deep-convolutional neural networks (CNN), a significant increase in performance can be obtained on these tasks.
